This project explores and visualizes patterns in car repair costs using a dataset of repair records. It examines how factors like scratch size, repair time, brand, and part type influence the cost of dents and scratches. The project provides key insights that can aid in cost estimation and repair prioritization.

-> Features:

1. Data Cleaning:
-Identifies and handles missing values and duplicate rows.
- Provides a summary of the dataset structure and statistical properties.
  
2. Visual Analysis:
- Distribution Analysis: Histograms for numerical features to identify data distributions.
- Correlation Heatmap: Highlights relationships among numerical features.
- Scatter Plots: Explores relationships between scratch size, repair time, and total cost, with categorical groupings.
- Box Plots: Analyzes cost variations across different brands and parts.
  
3. Insights and Observations:
- Correlations between key features and repair costs.
- Differences in costs across brands and parts.
- Identification of patterns like common scratch sizes or cost ranges.

-> Technologies Used: 

- Python: Programming language.
- Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.
- Seaborn: Advanced data visualization.
- Matplotlib: Plotting library.

-> How It Works: 

1. Data Loading:
- Reads an Excel file containing car repair records.
  
2. Data Cleaning:
- Summarizes missing values, duplicates, and data types for preprocessing.
  
3. Visual Exploration:
- Analyzes the distribution of numerical and categorical variables.
-Examines relationships between features and costs using scatter plots, box plots, and heatmaps.

4. Insights and Summary:
- Provides actionable insights into how various features impact repair costs.
